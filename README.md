This project was created as a part of an 8 hours Hackathon about diversity and inclusion. 
We created an interactive game that illustrates the day-to-day activities of the blind community - to recognize their difficulties and identify with them.
We built our app using React.


### Game description ###
The goal is to walk down the street to a certain destination. <br>
You can see your progress in reaching your destination. Using one of the direction buttons- forward, right or left you can take one step each time.<br>
In each step, you are supposed to hear audio feedback telling you what happened. You can hear you have bumped into a trash can and people are laughing or you have reached a cross road and need to wait for the right time to cross it etc. 
In the end, everyone manages to get to the destination but encounters different random events along the way.<br>


### How to play the game: ###
1. Press start the game
2. You can see your progress in reaching the destination on the bar to the right. Your position marks as the red slot.
3. Press one of the direction buttons- forward, right, or left.
4. In each step you are supposed to hear audio feedback telling you what happened.
5. When reaching the destination- the red slot will be at the end of the bar on the right.
6. You finished the game!

### Future features: ###
1. In the future we intend to add a "go blind mode"- which means that at the beginning of the game the player can see and look around,<br>
then when pressing the button, the screen will go dark (as the game is now).<br>
2. Adding a "reach out" button- this button will allow the player to try and "feel" what is around him with audio feedback.<br>
3. This game can be in a VR version. It may reach a more mature audience a will create a more vivid experience. <br>

### How to create the game using the uploaded files: ###
We used react as a platform, you should first download the files and open them on react.<br>
Then you should create a web page of the game on your local server- the test file should execute these actions.<br>
Note that after finishing the game, you should hit the refresh button to start over.<br>
